2013 ICFP Programming Contest Entry by DKMB (Dan Kang & Mark Barolak)
===========

This repository once had the misleading name of ocamlclient because it was used during a
live contest (not that anyone would copy us) as a public repository.

We scored 939 / 1420 on the original problem set, but didn't get to the bonus problems.
This score ranked somewhere between 50th (~1100) and 75th (904) among at least 522
registered teams, and higher than any of the lightning round entries.  We're very happy
about out performance and hope to do even better in the future.
